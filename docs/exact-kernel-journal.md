# An exact kernel of our own: the two weeks of #498

On `test/498-an-exact-kernel-of-our-own`, a branch that sits on #449's and is
never merged. The answer is written on #497; this is where the days are
accounted for, as #498 asks: what was reached on which day, what took the
time, and whether the failures a campaign finds go down from one run to the
next — the one sign that tells a tail that ends from one that does not.

Two weeks at most, from 2026-09-30 to 2026-10-13. Past that, nothing without
Tom's word.

## The cases

The stock is #449's: a cylinder of radius 20 standing on the XY plane from 0
to 10, and tools of radius 5. The block is 40 by 40 by 10, centred on the
origin, from 0 to 10.

| # | case | from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | a circle raised | #449 |
| 2 | a hole bored flush, off the axis, at (8, 0) | #449 |
| 3 | a hole bored through, off the axis | #449 |
| 4 | a hole bored flush, tangent to the wall, at (15, 0) | #449 |
| 5 | a hole bored through, tangent to the wall | #449 |
| 6 | a hole bored flush, on the axis | #449 |
| 7 | a hole bored through, on the axis | #449 |
| 8 | a hole bored flush but for a hair, from 1e-7 | #449 |
| 9 | a boss standing on the top | #449 |
| 10 | a boss sunk into the top | #449 |
| 11 | a boss overhanging the top's edge | truck failed it |
| 12 | two blocks side by side sharing a wall, flush or offset | truck failed it |
| 13 | a hole tangent to a side of a block | truck failed it |
| 14 | a cylinder resting against a flat face | truck failed it |
| 15 | two holes whose circles touch | truck failed it |
| 16 | a pocket flush with a side and the top | truck failed it |

## The days

### Day 1 — 2026-09-30

- Branch made from #498 on top of #449's. #449's table runs again as it was
  left: the flats keep every rule on nine of the ten cases, truck on four.
- Four designs of the kernel written independently and judged against the
  sixteen cases and the harness, before any code.
